# Short term
- Finish standard library
- Much more standard library tests
- Update documentation (in LaTeX)
- Garbage collector should mark free memory instead of actually freeing it
- Better error messages
- Clearer memory management names: gc_unset_root is completely unclear
- Profile and improve
- `let` and `cond` statements
- Set objects
- Allow comments in REPL?

# Bugs
- none that I know of (probably a bad sign)

# Long term
- Error handling
- Unicode support

# Possibilities
- Module system
- Object-oriented programming
- Variadic functions
- Convert AST to stack machine instructions???!!!
