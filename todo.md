# Short term
- Finish standard library
- Ensure that define cannot appear within expressions
- Much more standard library tests
- Update documentation
- Garbage collector should mark free memory instead of actually freeing it
- Better error messages

# Bugs
- none that I know of (probably a bad sign)

# Long term
- Error handling
- Unicode support

# Possibilities
- Module system
- Object-oriented programming
- Variadic functions
- Convert AST to stack machine instructions???!!!
